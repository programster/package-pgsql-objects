# Writes GitHub Actions annotations for a test run, which (unlike the logs) can be read without logging in to GitHub:
# a notice with the results of each PostgreSQL version, and errors listing the failed tests (grouped into at most 9,
# as a step can only show 10 error annotations), or the last lines of output if it failed without listing any (e.g. a
# fatal error). Works with the output of both testing/main.php and testing/run-all-versions.sh.
# Usage: testing/github-annotations.sh <title> <file with the test output> <the tests' exit code>
